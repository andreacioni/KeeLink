ðŸ›« KeeLink Web App has migrated ðŸ›«
---
Due to some technical difficulties to find a free and reliable PHP hosting provider, the entire backend was wrote in **Golang** and hosted on **Heroku**.

This rewrite also helps everyone is interested in private hosting of the backend service.

You could find the Golang implementation of KeeLink Web App, here: [keelink-service](https://github.com/andreacioni/keelink-service).
